# Introduction
Data management is the practice of collecting, keeping, and using data securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.

The goal of data management is to help people, organizations, and connected things optimize the use of data within the bounds of policy and regulation so that they can make decisions and take actions that maximize the benefit to the organization.

 **Actions or practices that contribute to effective storage, preservation and use of data and documentation throughout the research cycle, production cycle, operational cycle of an organization or entity.**

### Research Data
Recorded factual materials commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings. 

- Observational data

- Experimental data

- Simulation data

- Derived or compiled  data through data mining/ APIs/ Web scraping
---
## Overall Benefits

### Insulation Against Data Loss
 - Natural disasters- fires, floods
 - Loss through THEFT
 - Changing storage formats
 - Changing storage devices

### Mitigate Research Retraction
Research papers, journal articles are sometimes retracted due to data validity questions and concerns

### Advance New Discoveries

New discoveries can be included or added to existing projects
---
## Impacts of Effective Data Management

1. Increasing the impact and visibility of research

2. Promotes innovation and new data uses

3. Leads to new collaborations

4. Maximizes transparency and accountability

5. Enables Scrutiny of research findings

6. Encourages validation of research methods

7. Reduced the cost of duplicating data collection

8. Providing resources for education and training

## Repositories/ Sites/ Places for Data Management
### Figshare @ figshare.com

**Figshare** is a repository where users can make their data, papers, code, media and other research outputs available in a **citable, shareable and discoverable** manner. Research outputs can be shared **privately** with collaborators or made **public** in the name of **open research** or to comply with funder and publisher mandates.

*“Figshare wants to open up scientific research and data to the world.”*

### Github @ github.com

**GitHub** is a code hosting platform for **version control and collaboration**. It lets you and others work together on projects from **anywhere**. GitHub essentials include repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.

### KAGGLE @www.kaggle.com

Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

Kaggle got its start in 2010 by offering machine learning competitions and now also offers a public data platform, a cloud-based workbench for data science, and Artificial Intelligence education. 

### BigQuery @cloud.google.com/bigquery/

BigQuery is a fully managed enterprise data warehouse that helps you manage and analyze your data with built-in features like machine learning, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence.

BigQuery's serverless architecture lets you use SQL queries to answer your organization's biggest questions with zero infrastructure management. BigQuery's scalable, distributed analysis engine lets you query terabytes in seconds and petabytes in minutes.

### Data Science Dojo @datasciencedojo.com 

Data Science Dojo was founded in 2013 but it was a free Meetup group long before the official launch. With the aim to bring the knowledge of data science to everyone, short Bootcamps with the most comprehensive curriculum were initiated.

### TidyTuesday @github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday

TT is a weekly social data project in R where users explore a new dataset each week and share their findings on Twitter with #TidyTuesday.So it’s easy to see how users approached each dataset: the questions they asked, the plots they made, and the code they wrote.
